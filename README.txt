Description:
The purpose of this application is to allow for the collection
and use of data from the Extra Life site in a streaming
environment.

Usage:
After running the application, you will be prompted to enter
your team's ID. This can be found in the url of your extra life
team page (it should read something to the affect of '&teamID='.
Keep in mind, you only need the number here.

Once you have loaded your team's information, you can then set
the path of the text files that the information will save to.
The program tracks the top donation, most recent donation, and
the total donation in text files and also lists the three most
recent donations and the current total raised vs. the goal in
the program itself. Once you have chosen your file paths and
saved them, you can then proceed to hit the 'Run' button. This
will cause the program to continually update those text files
and other information until you tell it to stop. Now all you
have to do is load the text information in your stream software,
and the numbers will update automatically so you can format
it however you'd like.

Note: If the Extra Life Team has expired due to the event being
over, you can access the team but no participants and data will
be available, which will render the program ineffective. Make sure
you are accessing via the team for the current year's Extra Life.

Known Bugs:
Entering a Team ID that doesn't exist in Extra Life's system will
still attempt to pull it's data as Extra Life does not return a
'404 Not Found' or anything as such.
